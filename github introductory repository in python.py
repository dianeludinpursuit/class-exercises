Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub repository for Pursuit! As Emily Dickinson, a poet of profound observation, once penned, 
"That it will never come again / Is what makes life so sweet." This sentiment resonates with the journey of 
learning and creation encapsulated within this repositoryâ€”each project a unique moment, never to be precisely 
replicated, yet contributing to a growing tapestry of skill and understanding. Feel free to explore the different 
directories to see my work, a testament to the sweet, fleeting moments of development and discovery.
