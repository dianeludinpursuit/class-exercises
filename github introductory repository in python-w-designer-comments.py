# This script is designed to deliver our project's introductory text.
# Think of it as a small, automated display for our GitHub repository's welcome message.

# IMPORTANT NOTE FOR DESIGNERS:
# When collaborating with our AI tools (like Gemini), being super clear with your
# instructions is key. Just like a design brief, the more specific you are
# about what you want (e.g., "use this exact font," "make this button purple"),
# the better the AI can produce results that match your vision.

# This section creates a reusable "block" of content for our introduction.
# We're defining *what* the introduction is, so we can show it whenever we need to.

Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub repository for Pursuit! As Emily Dickinson, a poet of profound observation, once wrote, "That it will never come again / Is what makes life so sweet." This sentiment resonates with the journey of learning and creation encapsulated within this repositoryâ€”each project a unique moment, never to be precisely replicated, yet contributing to a growing tapestry of skill and understanding. Feel free to explore the different directories to see my work, a testament to the sweet, fleeting moments of development and discovery.

    # makes it visible. In a web context, this is similar to how text
    # gets rendered onto a page for the user to read.

# This part ensures that our introduction is displayed automatically
# when someone runs this script. It's the trigger that makes the content appear.
# Think of it as the 'play' button for our welcome message.
